# Summary
Using AngularJS, I built a like button. The button keeps track of how many times it has been clicked and gets updated with each click.  There is a second button that toggles whether clicks are added or subtracted.  

The project can be found at: [Angular Like Button](https://tiy-mikaelchen-angular-button.surge.sh).
